In This project we are processing our famous website geeksforgeeks.org. 
As we always see there are lots of ads present on geeksforgeeks and also what we need is the only main aread(or text part of the link
where actual code are present) not the all links which usually floats around the page.
so what we are providing here is a GUI(Java based ) where each link will be categorised based on there data sturcture
Also we can visit by Question number(we Mainaining numbers for each link) and in the Main window we are extarcting the only text part 
from geeksforgeeks and displaying in Main winndow of the GUI.

Pre-requisites are :
Internet Connection
Java 1.6+
